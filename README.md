# Portfolio-management (MPT):

We study the risk and outcome resulting from a combination of financial assets. 

#### 1- Case of 2 assets (initial).

#### 2- Adding a 3rd asset to improve return for a fixed risk or reduce risk for a fixed return (we call it improved performance of the portfolio).

#### 3- Adding a 4th asset to improve the performance. 

This perforamnce is monitored using Risk Vs. Return graphics.
